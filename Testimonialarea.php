                                    <p>What experience is needed for IT?
                                    You need a four-year degree in computer science to get into IT. You need a technical degree to get an entry-level tech support job. The things you need to know to excel in a technology job are only taught in college.</p>

                                        Majority of the service-based employees who didn't have the urge to skill-up and only delivered what they were supposed to â€” will face super hard time.</p>

                                  - Became a director for a service based company with head count 100 to 130.

                                  - Became a project manager/product owner either full time or part time consultant.</p>
